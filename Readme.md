Task to Achieve:
- We will make a UI from where we will take the signatures.
- Store this signature on pinata and then pinata will generate hash of those signatures.
- Store the generated signature's hash to the db(mongoose)
- then we will validate these from from the smart contracts

-- pinata.js ---- consists of json 
-- controller ---
-- config -- db.js -- daa
